## Introduction

Tired of hitting storage limits on popular cloud services like Google Drive (15GB free tier) or Dropbox? Frustrated by the recurring costs of expanding your cloud storage? This project presents a unique, self-hosted solution leveraging the robust infrastructure of Telegram.

**Problem:** Traditional cloud storage providers offer limited free storage and charge for more space, creating a barrier for users needing larger, personal storage solutions.

**Solution:** This application allows you to create your *own* private cloud storage system using a Telegram Bot and a private Telegram Channel as the backend storage layer. You deploy the application yourself, connect it to your own Telegram resources, and gain control over your storage space and privacy. While Telegram has its own file size limits (2GB per file for standard bots), the application includes logic to handle larger files by automatically splitting them into chunks before uploading, effectively allowing storage of files larger than the standard limit.

## Features

*   **Self-Deployable:** Host the application on your own infrastructure.
*   **Unlimited Storage (Subject to Telegram):** Storage capacity is effectively limited only by your Telegram account's capacity and the terms of service of Telegram itself, offering a potentially unlimited solution compared to standard free tiers.
*   **Privacy Control:** You control the Telegram Bot and Channel, meaning your data resides in your private space.
*   **Large File Support:** Handles files larger than Telegram's standard 2GB limit by automatically splitting them into manageable chunks during upload and reassembling them during download.
*   **Folder Structure:** Organize your files using a folder system within the application interface.
*   **File Sharing:** Generate public links for specific files to share with others (optional feature).
*   **Dark Theme:** Default shadcn/ui dark theme for a modern look.

## How It Works

1.  **Setup:** You create a private Telegram Channel and a Telegram Bot using `@BotFather`. You configure the application with the Bot Token and Channel ID.
2.  **Upload:** When you upload a file through the web interface:
    *   **Small Files (â‰¤ 2GB):** The file is sent directly to your Telegram Channel via the Bot API. Metadata (filename, Telegram message ID, folder location) is stored in the application's database.
    *   **Large Files (> 2GB):** The file is split into chunks (e.g., 1GB each) in the browser. Each chunk is uploaded sequentially to your Telegram Channel. Metadata for each chunk (filename, chunk index, session ID, Telegram message ID for the chunk, folder location) is stored in the database.
3.  **Storage:** The actual file data resides in your Telegram Channel. The application database stores metadata linking filenames and folder structures to the corresponding Telegram message IDs.
4.  **Download:**
    *   **Small Files:** The application retrieves the Telegram message ID from the database and uses the Telegram API to fetch and serve the file to the user.
    *   **Large Files:** The application retrieves all chunk metadata associated with the original file's session ID. It fetches each chunk sequentially from Telegram and reassembles them before serving the complete file to the user.
5.  **Folder Management:** The application maintains folder structures by associating file metadata with a `parentFolderId` in the database.
6.  **Sharing:** If enabled, the application can generate unique tokens for files, creating public endpoints (`/api/public/[token]`) that allow direct download via the stored Telegram message ID.

## Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Version 18 or later.
*   **MongoDB Atlas Account:** A free cluster is sufficient for basic use.
*   **Telegram Account:** Required to create the Bot and Channel.
*   **A Server/Platform:** To deploy the Next.js application (e.g., VPS, Railway, Vercel).

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohdyaserkt/global-hackathon-v1
    cd global-hackathon-v1/my-app
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create Telegram Bot and Channel:**
    *   Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`.
    *   Start a chat and use `/newbot` to create a new bot. Follow the prompts to get your **Bot Token**.
    *   Create a **Private Telegram Channel** where your files will be stored.
    *   Add your newly created bot to the channel as an administrator, granting it permission to post messages (and potentially delete messages if you implement deletion).

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy the `example\ .env` file to `.env`:
        ```bash
        cp example\ .env .env
        ```
    *   Open `.env` in a text editor and fill in the required values:
        ```env
        # MongoDB Atlas Connection String
        MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string

        # Telegram Bot Token
        TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token

        # Telegram Channel ID
        TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=your_private_channel_id

        # Admin Credentials for Login Page
        ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email
        ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
        ```

5.  **Deploy:**
    *   Follow the deployment instructions for your chosen platform (Vercel, Railway, etc.), ensuring your environment variables are correctly set during the deployment process.

## Usage

1.  Navigate to your deployed application URL (`[Your Deployed App URL]`).
2.  Go to the `/login` page and enter the `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` configured in your `.env.local`.
3.  You will be redirected to the main storage interface.
4.  Use the "New" button in the sidebar to create folders or upload files.
5.  Click on folders in the sidebar or main content area to navigate and organize your files.
6.  Upload files using the "Upload File" button in the sidebar.
7.  Manage existing files using the action buttons (Download, Share).
